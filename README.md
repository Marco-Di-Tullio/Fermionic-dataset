# Fermionic dataset for Machine Learning
Dataset generation and implementation for performing Machine Learning with fermionic states. 

- Dataset generation is a code writen in Julia using the (Fermionic.jl)[https://github.com/Marco-Di-Tullio/Fermionic.jl] library. It simulates a superconducting Hamiltonian and generates exact states in both superconducting and normal phases.
- Dataset qiskit is written in Python using Qiskit. It opens the dataset and inputs them into a Qiskit algorithm [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1jlpUc4fiir2d6e7W1HwYX0BMZkfnD-1f?usp=sharing)
